The mcmTheater API provides a set of classes that build a simple framework to develop
Java Screensavers and Applets. The applets can run on any Internet browser and the 
screensavers can be executed on Windows and Unix platforms.

The MCM Theater package was developed as a vehicle to teach computer programming
to older middle and high school students. The ideas in this package are heavily
influenced by Turtle Logic, which has been developed at MIT to teach programming
to even younger students. MCM Theater enables students to develop visually appealing
programs with a minimal amount of Java code.
