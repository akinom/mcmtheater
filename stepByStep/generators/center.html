is a very simple actor, which moves on a straight 
line to the stage's edge and once there finishes its execution,
see <A href=#onceacross>bottom of page</a>.
The two generators below are very similar. They run forever repeatedly creating a new <code>OnceAcross</code> actor, setting its movement direction and position to be the same direction and position as their own, starting it on the stage, turning a little bit to the left, and taking a short break before creating the next actor with the new direction. 
<p>

<p> 
This initial actor does the minimum necessary: it creates a 
<code>OnceAcross</code> actor, sets its direction and position, starts it, 
turns 29 degrees to the left and takes a little 
<code>sleep</code>ing break. Turning between creating actors is essential since the initial actor uses its own direction, which the
<code>getDirection()</code> method call returns, to set the created actor's direction using <code>across.setDirection(...)</code>.
<code>sleep</code>ing is essential to make sure that the created actors get a chance to move before new actors are created.
Since the initial actor turns 29 degrees which is not a factor of 360 and a prime number it must turn 360 times before it returns to its initial direction. Only then does it 'shoot' actors off in a direction it shot in before.

This actor adds a few statements for beauties sake. 
It creates a circle shape that is shared by all actors. 
The initial actor assigns the shape to itself in its second statement, 
"<code>setShape(shape);</code>", and uses it for the actors it creates, see  
"<code>across.setShape(shape);</code>".  
It sets the trail visibility and step size of the actors it creates so that they do not leave a trail and move relatively slowly.
