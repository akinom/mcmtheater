<p>
The pages in this section explain how an actor that knows how to draw a triangle can be modified to generate sophisticated combinations of triangles to make attractive patterns. 
The ideas in these pages are easily applied to other shapes. 
As soon as an actor has 'learned' to move along a pretty path it can use any of the ideas in these pages to form more sophisticated patterns.

<p>
The applet to the left shows a simple triangle drawing actor which serves as the starting point for the more sophisticated actors in the other examples.
</p><p>
The second applet shows an actor that draws a sequence of triangles of different sizes rotated about a center. As a whole they look like a pin wheel pattern. The actor changes its trail color and the stage's background color before starting with a new pin wheel pattern. 
</p><p>
The third applet contains three actors simultaneously  drawing lines of triangles in three different colors. Whenever a line reaches the stage's edge it starts over at a randomly chosen position.
</p><p>
The applet on the right is the most complicated example. It shows three actors simultaneously moving about the stage drawing red, green, or blue triangles. 
Their movement is semi random.
After completing each triangle at one of the triangle's corners,  they randomly decide at which of the two other corners to continue.
