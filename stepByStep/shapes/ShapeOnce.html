<p>
The actor in the applet below moves along the edges of a triangle with an edge length of 40 pixels. 
It moves 40 pixels between turns and makes a total of three turns whose angles add up to 360 degree.
Thus the actor points back to its original direction when it is done.
</p>

<p>
<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
local_debug = "true";
local_applet('ShapeOnce',
'public void act() {\n' + 
'   move(40);\n' +
'   right(120);\n' +
'   move(40);\n' +
'   right(120);\n' +
'   move(40);\n' +
'   right(120);\n' +
'}'
);

<p>
This second actor draws the same triangle as the one above but does so forever.
Note that after drawing one triangle the actor ends at the 
<b>same position pointed in the same direction </b>as before calling its triangle drawing 
<code>shape</code> method. Thus calling 
its <code>shape</code> repeatedly causes the actor to travel the same triangular path again and again and again ...
</p> 
<p>
The actor's program is a modification of the first actor. The new  
<code>shape</code> method contains the same statements as the previous actor's
<code>act</code> method. 
This actor's <code>act</code> method simply calls the triangle drawing <code>shape</code> method within its <code>while (true)</code> loop, which is Java speak for "Do it Forever."

local_applet('ShapeForever',

'}\n' + 
'\n' + 
'public void shape() {\n' + 
'   move(40);\n' +
'   right(120);\n' +
'   // and so forth ...\n' + 
'   // same as in act method above\n' +
