It creates the three actors by calling <code>makeShapeLine</code> three times passing the color and direction that the new actor should use. 
</p> 
<p>
<code>makeShapeLine</code>  creates a new <code>ShapeCtrLineJump</code> actor and assigns a reference to this new actor to the variable <code>actor</code>. 
It then sets the new actor's direction to the given <code>angle</code> and its trail color to the given <code>color</code>. 
It makes sure the actor is invisible, meaning that the actor will not show a shape. It assigns 100 as the new actor's step size, which makes its movement real fast, and it gives the actor a 2 pixel trail width.
It finally starts the newly created actor on the stage. 
Note that to do all this all method calls in <code>makeShapeLine</code> are preceeded by <code>actor.</code> which is necessary to make explicit that the new <code>actor's</code> direction, visibility, ... is to be changed not the initial actor's direction, visibility, ...

The actor below clears the stage periodically. 
It adds a few statements to alternate between  sleeping for 300 ticks on the stage's clock and clearing the stage. 
Now that the initial actor continues the execution of its act method indefinitely it is made invisible.
