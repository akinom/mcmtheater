</SCRIPT>

<p> 
To design a visually pleasing mcmTheater program a programmer must take care that the stage changes not just in a small region. 
Jumping actors like the ones on this page do just that. 
The first actor below randomly jumps around the stage drawing triangles. 
The second actor jumps randomly around the stage as well but it rotates each triangle a little to the right.

'public void act() {\n' + 
'   while (true) {\n' + 
'      jumpTo(Dice.throwPoint(getStage()));\n' + 
'      shape(25);\n' + 
'   }\n' +

<p> 
The second actor on this stage draws a more interesting pattern than the first 
but its stage does become cluttered and untidy after a while. 
The actors on the next stage improve this situation.
