<p>
The applet below starts four yellow and four green <code>Bouncers</code>.  
The <code>makeGreenYellow</code> method contains the same statements as the <code>act</code> method in the previous example.
In fact this initial actor came about by copying its code, renaming the <code> act</code> method to <code>makeGreenYellow</code>, editing it slightly,  and writing the <code> act</code> method shown below.

local_applet('FourGreenYellow',

<p> 
The <code>act</code> method contains a <code>for</code> loop that wraps one statement, a call to <code>makeGreenYellow</code>.
Each time <code>makeGreenYellow</code> is called, its statements are executed which create a green and a yellow bouncing balloon. 
Since it is called multiple times 
<code>makeGreenYellow</code> must avoid creating ballons that start at the same position and head into the same direction which is the reason for changes in the way the bouncers are initialized. 
In this example they are forced to jump to a random position on stage instead of the stage's center  before they start. The initial actor sets their direction angle randomly as opposed to using 15 or 30 degree angles. 
</p> 

<p> 
<code>For</code> loops in general serve to execute something multiple times. 
The <code>for</code> loop in this example states that the 
<code>makeGreenYellow</code> method call must be repeated  4 times. 

The variable <code>i</code> is set to 1 when the loop starts, and its value is increased by one for each repetition.

The loop finishes once <code>i</code> becomes bigger than 4. 

Thus the loop executes 4 times, once with the variable <code>i</code> set to 1, once with <code>i</code> set to 2, once with <code>i</code> set to 3,  and a last time with <code>i</code> set to 4.  

In this simple loop 
<code>i</code> serves as a counter only whose value is used to make sure that 
<code>makeGreenYellow</code> is in fact called exactly 4 times.
