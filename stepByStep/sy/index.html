<p>
Sy, a 7th grader, was the first user of the mcmTheater package.
After a brief introduction to the package's features, I put him in front of a computer, showed him a simple <code>Actor</code> that draws a square and let him dive into his first programming experience. I simply gave him ideas what he might try and let him choose. 
</P> 
<p> 
Sy started by changing the initial aquare drawning <code>Actor</code> into one that draws a fixed size rectangle over and over and over again.
We added another <code>Actor</code> which served to start five of Sy's Rectangles.
Sy changed colors and line width as well as <code>Actor</code>'s starting positions. 
After about half an hour he had produced a pretty drawing program. 
</p> 

<p>
Click on <a href="Square.html">Step By Step Explanations</a> to see how Sy proceeded from the original program.
Each step is explained on its own page, which shows an applet executing the step's actor or actors.
Code excerpts explain how the step's <code>Actor</code> was programmed. 
The complete Java code can be viewed by clicking the JavaSource link under the page's applet. Applets can be started from the beginning by clicking on Restart.
