<p>
Now Sy wanted to draw more than one Rectangle at a time. 
I used this program as a template to show him how an <code>Actor</code> can start other <code>Actors</code>. 
In this simple case two <code>ShowShape</code> actors are created, positioned, and started on the <code>Stage</code>. 
The mcmTheater package defines the 
<code>ShowShape</code> Actor class. It is very simple as one can see 
below: <code>ShowShape</code> actors simply stay at the location where they are put on <code>Stage</code>. 
</p> 
<p> 
When an <code>Actor</code> starts it appears on the <code>Stage</code>. 
The position where it appears is defined by x and y coordinates in the 
<code>Stage</code>'s coordinate system. The <code>Stage</code>'s origin is at the lower left corner of the applet's window. 
</p> 

<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
sy_applet(); 
sy_code(
'Actor a;\n' + 
'\n' +
'a = new ShowShape();   // create a new ShowShape actor \n' + 
'a.jumpTo(10, 20);      // force it to go to position (10, 20)\n' + 
'a.start(getStage());   // tell it to start acting on the stage \n' + 
'\n' + 
'a = new ShowShape();   // create a new ShowShape actor \n' + 
'a.jumpTo(30, 40);      // force it to go to position (30, 40)\n' + 
'a.start(getStage());   // tell it to start acting on the stage \n' 
);
