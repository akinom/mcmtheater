Although the mcmTheater package was originally developed to introduce old middle school and high school students to computer programming through the development of screensavers it is well suited for games development. 
The same classes that are used to animate and display screensavers can be used to animate and display a game. 
The package contains a few game specific classes that manage the main game loop, that help keep track of mouse and keyboard input, and that support the management of game scenes/boards.  
</p> 
<p> 
We developed these game specific  classes by developing actual games Three of these are featured here:
