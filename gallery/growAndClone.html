Actors. 
It chooses a short start delay randomly to avoid that the actors perform in lock step. 
The initial actor, when creating them, sets their minimum shape size to  10 pixels, their maximum size to  a third of the average of the stage's width and height.
Half the actors are started with a square, the other half with a circle shape. 
The time delay that the GrowShapeAndClone actors use to clone themselves is set so that an actor's clone appears on stage when the actor itself has grown about a fifth of the total growth it goes through. 
GrowShapeAndClone actors decide randomly whether to position their clone at their own position (4 out of 5 times on average) or a random position on stage (1 out of 5 times).
