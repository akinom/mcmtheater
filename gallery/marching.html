The initial actor below starts three MarchingLines actors with shapes that are 
a quarter of the stage wide and a third of the stage high.
MarchingLines actors move forward a given distance, start a clone of themselves, positioning it at its own starting position and then proceed moving until they fall of the stage's edge.
Clones have the same properties as their creators except for their shape color, which is either slightly modified from their creator's color (9 out of 10 cases on average) or a randomly chosen color (1 out of 10 cases).
