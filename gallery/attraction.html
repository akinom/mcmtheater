The mcmTheater program below is inspired by a physics question from the 
<A href=http://www.paideiaschool.org>Paideia School</a> in Atlanta, Georgia: 
Particle A, B, and C are placed at the corners of a regular triangle. 
If A attracts B, B attracts C, and C attracts A, how do A, B, and C move towards each other ? How far do they travel before they meet ? 
</p>

<SCRIPT LANGUAGE="JavaScript">
wd(qs_table_start(0)); 
wd("<TR><TD>"); 
local_applet_plain('TriangleAttraction',  
                    new Array(new Array("STP", "1" ) ));
wd(local_java_ref('TriangleAttraction'));
wd("<BR>"); 
wd(local_java_ref('Particle', 'Particle'));
wd("</TD></TR>");
wd(qs_table_finish());

<p> 
The program above consists of an initial actor that starts three 
<code>Particle</code> actors, one at each corner of a regular triangle. 
To distinguish the three further they are given 
red, blue, and green circle shapes and trail colors.  
Each <code>Particle</code> has a <code>leader</code> towards which it moves.
The initial actor sets the 'blue' <code>Particle</code>  actor's leader to be the 'red'  actor.
The 'red' actor's leader to be the 'green' actor and  
the 'green' actor's leader to be the 'blue' actor.
</p> 
<p>
The <code>Particle</code> actors do the following once they start:
They check where their leaders are,
set their direction so they are heading towards them,
move  a few  pixels forward towards their leader,
recheck their leader's positions,
readjust their direction,
move some more pixels forward, ... 
until they get close enough to their leaders. 
How many pixles an actor moves between checking its leader's position depends on the actor's step size. In 
the applet above actor's use a step size of 1 pixel. Being close enough to the leader is defined as: the distance between the leader's and actor's positions is smaller than the actor's step size.
</p> 
<p> 
The initial actor starts another set of three 
<code>Particle</code> actors whenever the previous set meets at the triangle's center.
