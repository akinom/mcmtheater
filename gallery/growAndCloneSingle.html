<p>
The initial actor below is a  GrowShapeAndClone actor that the mcmTheater 
program creates using the default constructor, see definition of 
<code>GrowShapeAndClone()</code> in the source code. 
Thus the initial actor below grows its shaps from a minimum size of 10 pixels to a maximum size of 210 pixels. 
The initial actor creates a clone of itself with the same shape type, and minimum and maximum shape sizes. 
It starts the clone after 40 clock ticks of starting itself.
Thus new GrowShapeAndClone actors appear every 40 clock ticks. 
On average in 4 out of 5 cases clones appear at the same position as the creating actor. 
In 1 out of 5 cases they jump to a random position on stage.
