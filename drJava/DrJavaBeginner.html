<H3> What to do with the "Locate tools.jar" dialog that DrJava pops up when I start it ? </H3> 
</a>

<p> <img src=img/DrJavaLocateTools.jpg> </p>
<p>
DrJava wants to know where tools.jar is located. 
tools.jar contains the tools that DrJava needs to 
compile and execute programs. You <b>must</b> 
tell DrJava where to find it, so <b>click "Yes"</b>. 
</p> 
tools.jar is usually located in
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk....\lib\tools.jar. 
So navigate to that file, select it, and click "Open". 
</p>

<A name=beforeAll>
<H3> Before you do anything you must ... </H3> 
</a>
<p> 
<UL> 
<LI> 
<H3> Open your current project </h4>
All programming files, that I give to you, are part 
of DrJava projects. Eeach time, that you start DrJava, 
your first action must be to open 
the project file that comes with your current program. 
Project information is stored in files that have a ".pjt"
extension. All starter projects are stored in 
mcmUser\drJava\&lt;SomeName&gt;.pjt. 
</p> 
<p> 
To open a project use the "Open" option from the "Project" menu, 
see <a href=img/DrJavaOpenProject.jpg>DrJava Window</a> </p>
</p><p>
<b>Do not</b> use the "Open" short cut button, neither the "Open" option in 
the File menu. These add a single file to the current project instead of opening
a complete project with <b>all</b> its file.
</p> 
</LI> 
<LI> 

<a name=compileAll>
<H3> Compile everything </h4>
</a>
<p> 
Once you successfully opened a project compile everything. You can do that 
in any of the following three ways: 
<UL> 
<LI> Choosing the "Compile All Documents" option from the "Tools" menu, 
see <a href=img/DrJavaToolsCompileAll.jpg> DrJava Window </a> </LI>
<LI> Clicking the "Compile All" short cut button. </LI> 
<LI> Right clicking on the project name in the tree view tab on the left, 
see <a href=DrJavaProjectCompile.jpg>DrJava Window </a> </LI>
</LI>
</UL> 
</LI> 

<LI> 
<H3>Test whether you can start your Actor </H3> 
<p>
All projects, that I give to you, contain a file called TryStart.hist. 
All TryMeStart.hist files start an Actor in 
its own window/Stage. 
First click on the Interactions Tab at the bottom, right click inside 
the Interactions tab,and choosee "Execute Interactions History", choose 
your TryMeStart.hist file,
see <a href=img/DrJavaTryMeStartExec.jpg>DrJava Window </a>

<a name=getRidInteraction>
<H3> How do I get rid of '//End of Interaction//' in Java files ? </H3> 
</a>
<p> 
This can be done with the help of "Find and Replace" from the "Edit" menu, 
see <a href=img/DrJavaEditFinidReplace.jpg>DrJava Window</a>.
</p><p>
"Find Replace" adds a Tab at the bottom of DrJava's Window, 
see <a href=img/DrJavaFindReplace.jpg>DrJava Window</a>.
</p><p>
Enter '//End of Interaction//' in the 'Find Next" text area on the left 
and make sure the 'Replace With' area on the right is empty, 
see <a href=img/DrJavaEditGetRid.jpg>DrJava Window</a>.
</p><p> 
Click "Find Next". This find the first occurence of 
'//End of Interaction//' in the file, that is currently displayed in the 
edit pane. The Click "Replace/Find Next". This replaces
'//End of Interaction//' with nothing and finds the next occurence. 
Repeat "Replace/Find Next" until all have been deleted.
</p> 

<a name=replaceSemi>
<H3> How do I replace all '//End of Interaction//' with ';' ? </H3> 
</a>
<p> 
This can be done with the help of "Find and Replace" from the "Edit" menu, 
see <a href=img/DrJavaEditFinidReplace.jpg>DrJava Window</a>.
</p><p>
"Find Replace" adds a Tab at the bottom of DrJava's Window, 
see <a href=img/DrJavaFindReplace.jpg>DrJava Window</a>.
</p><p>
Enter '//End of Interaction//' in the 'Find Next" text area on the left 
and enter ';' in the 'Replace With' area on the right.
see <a href=img/DrJavaEditSemicolon.jpg>DrJava Window</a>.
</p><p> 
Click "Find Next". This find is the first occurence of 
'//End of Interaction//' in the file, that is currently displayed in the 
edit pane. The Click "Replace/Find Next". This replaces
'//End of Interaction//' with a ';' and finds the next occurence. 
Repeat "Replace/Find Next" have been replpaced by semicolons.
</p> 


<a name=mustSaveDia>
<H3> What is that "Must Save All Files To Continue" Dialog ? </H3> 
</a>
<p>
<img src=img/DrJavaMustSaveAll.jpg>
</p> 
<p> 
DrJava must make sure that the compiler 'sees' all changes you made 
to your files. This dialog appears if you have not saved all your files. 
This meaans that some editing changes 
have not been written to the file system and the compiler can therefore 
not 'see' them. Definetely <b>click "Yes"</b>. It is also OK to choose "Always save before compiling". If you do you will not see this dialog again.
</p>


<a name=editBut>
<H3> I edited the Java file but my Actor doesn't seem to do the new statements. </H3> 
</a>
<p>
You probably did not compile the edited code. Compile everything
by doing one of the following:
<UL> 
<LI> Choosing the "Compile All Documents" option from the "Tools" menu, 
see <a href=img/DrJavaToolsCompileAll.jpg> DrJava Window </a> </LI>
<LI> Clicking the "Compile All" short cut button. </LI> 
<LI> Right clicking on the project name in the tree view tab on the left, 
see <a href=DrJavaProjectCompile.jpg>DrJava Window </a> </LI>
</LI>
</UL> 
</P>  
<p>
If the compilation prints "Last compilation completed successfully." to 
the Compiler Ouput Tab 
(see <a href=img/DrJavaCompileSuccess.jpg>DrJava Window)</a>
you are fine and should now be able to execute the new statements.
</p>
<p>
If you do see error messages in the Compiler Ouput Tab, 
(see <a href=img/DrJavaCompileError.jpg>DrJava Window)</a> 
you need to fix all of them and compile again.  
</P>
